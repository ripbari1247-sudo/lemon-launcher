# Architecture

This page describes how the Bandit Launcher UWP host is organized after the `App.cpp` split. It is meant for contributors who need to find launch, auth, UI, or loader code quickly.

## Overview

Bandit Launcher is a single UWP process that:

1. Authenticates the user with Microsoft and verifies Minecraft Java ownership.
2. Manages profiles, mods, and launcher UI state.
3. Verifies and downloads official runtime files into `LocalState`.
4. Embeds the JVM, applies loader specific launch rules, and starts Minecraft.
5. Exposes optional local network file access and diagnostics collection.

The UWP shell in `MC.Xbox/App.cpp` orchestrates startup and menu flow. Most behavior lives in feature folders under `MC.Xbox/`.

## Source Layout

```text
MC.Xbox/
  App.cpp                 UWP entry, App lifecycle, Run() orchestration
  runtime_config.h.in     Build time version template
  common/                 Shared helpers, crash reports
  net/                    HTTP client, remote file server
  auth/                   Microsoft / Minecraft auth
  ui/                     Launcher UI, auth screen, UI globals
  mods/                   Modrinth browser, defaults, mod types
  profiles/               Profile storage and target selection
  launch/                 Runtime downloads, JVM launch, loader dispatch
    app_globals.*
    runtime_manager.*
    minecraft_launch.*
    launch_internal.*
    loaders/
      loader.*            Loader dispatch facade
      loader_common.*     Shared loader parsing/helpers
      fabric.*            Fabric launch provider
      neoforge.*          NeoForge launch provider
      forge.*             Forge stub for future work
```

`build.ps1` compiles sources from these folders with include paths for `.`, `common`, `net`, `auth`, `ui`, `mods`, `profiles`, `launch`, and `launch/loaders`.

## Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `App.cpp` | `wWinMain`, CoreApplication lifecycle, high level `Run()` sequencing between auth, UI, downloads, and launch. |
| `common/launcher_common` | Path helpers, environment access, shared string/path utilities used across modules. |
| `common/crash_report` | Collect launcher and game diagnostics into crash report archives. |
| `auth/minecraft_auth` | Device code sign in, token exchange, ownership verification, session state. |
| `ui/launcher_ui` | Main menu rendering and interaction. |
| `ui/auth_screen` | Sign in screen and QR/device code presentation. |
| `mods/mods_browser` | Modrinth search, version resolution, install into active profile. |
| `mods/mod_defaults` | Launcher seeded mod compatibility defaults per target. |
| `profiles/profiles` | Profile CRUD, per profile game dirs, selected launch target. |
| `net/http_client` | Shared HTTP helpers for downloads and APIs. |
| `net/remote_file_server` | Local network upload/download UI backend. |
| `launch/runtime_manager` | Manifest verification, parallel downloads, version JSON resolution, native library prep. |
| `launch/minecraft_launch` | Shared JVM embed path: classpath assembly, natives, game args, process local Java startup. |
| `launch/launch_internal` | Low level Java invocation helpers used by loader specific prep. |
| `launch/loaders/*` | Loader specific version finalization, artifact prep, classpath, and JVM args. |

```

### Runtime preparation

`launch/runtime_manager.cpp` owns most download and version resolution work:

- Reads packaged `download_manifest.tsv` and per target manifests under `runtime/manifests/`.
- Verifies SHA1 hashes under `LocalState`.
- Downloads missing or stale official libraries, client metadata, and assets.
- Prepares native library folders for the selected target.

When version JSON needs loader specific fields, `ResolveVersionInfo()` delegates to `LoaderFinalizeVersionInfo()` in `launch/loaders/loader.cpp`.

### Shared JVM launch

`launch/minecraft_launch.cpp` handles the common embed path:

- Locates packaged JREs (`jre`, `jre21`).
- Builds the base classpath from resolved version data.
- Applies UWP native library paths and GLFW shim placement.
- Calls loader hooks before adjusting classpath and JVM options.
- Starts the selected main class in the same UWP process.

Loader specific behavior should not be reimplemented here. Add or extend a loader module instead.

## Loader Plugin Pattern

`launch/loaders/loader.h` defines the loader dispatch surface:

| Hook | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LoaderFinalizeVersionInfo` | Fill loader specific version metadata after base resolution. |
| `LoaderBeforeLaunch` | Pre launch filesystem or config preparation. |
| `LoaderAdjustClasspath` | Add loader jars, patched clients, or module path entries. |
| `LoaderAddJvmOptions` | Add loader specific JVM flags, patch module args, or system properties. |
| `LoaderPrepareArtifactsAfterJvm` | Late artifact generation that needs JVM helpers. |

`launch/loaders/loader.cpp` parses the active loader id and forwards each hook to the matching provider.

Shared parsing helpers live in `launch/loaders/loader_common.*`.

### Fabric

`launch/loaders/fabric.cpp` handles Fabric loader versioning, classpath additions, and Fabric specific JVM arguments for supported targets.

### NeoForge

`launch/loaders/neoforge.cpp` is the largest provider today. It covers:

- NeoForge install metadata and artifact preparation.
- FML/UCP config generation.
- Patched client handling from downloaded official inputs.
- securejarhandler patch module arguments.
- NeoForge classpath and JVM option assembly.

NeoForge generates patched client artifacts on first launch from downloaded official inputs. Do not commit or redistribute generated NeoForge client jars.

### Forge

`launch/loaders/forge.cpp` is currently a stub. Catalog entries may exist in `config/versions.tsv`, but `supported = false` and launch attempts log that Forge is not implemented yet.

To add legacy Forge support later:

1. Implement the loader hooks in `launch/loaders/forge.cpp`.
2. Add or update the target row in `config/versions.tsv`.
3. Ensure `build.ps1` generates the matching manifest and any patched runtime artifacts.
4. Register the provider in `launch/loaders/loader.cpp` if dispatch rules change.

## Build Time vs Runtime Configuration

At build time, `build.ps1` generates `runtime_config.h` from `MC.Xbox/runtime_config.h.in` using values from `scripts/config.ps1` and CLI overrides. That header supplies default package versions to host modules.

At runtime, the launcher reads:

- `runtime/version_catalog.tsv` for selectable targets.
- `runtime/manifests/<target-id>.tsv` for per target download requirements.
- `download_manifest.tsv` for shared official runtime verification.

Changing the default target requires updating `scripts/config.ps1` and usually `config/versions.tsv`. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the full checklist.

| Change Modrinth install behavior | `mods/mods_browser.cpp` |
| Change remote uploads | `net/remote_file_server.cpp` |

## Auth Boundary

Bandit Launcher requires legitimate Microsoft/Xbox authentication and Minecraft entitlement verification. Architecture changes must keep that boundary intact. Do not add offline fallbacks, optional auth switches, or alternate launch paths that skip ownership checks.
